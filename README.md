## 🚀 About This Project

This was one of my very first projects when I just started my coding journey.
To be honest… it’s a bit of a Frankenstein monster — full of messy code, broken rules, and unfinished features. But hey, that’s the beauty of learning! 🎉

At the time, I was just a junior dev trying to build something awesome (and maybe impress future me). Along the way, I picked up a lot:

⚛️ React framework basics (and how not to structure a project)

🛠️ Building backend APIs that sometimes actually work

🎨 UI experiments that may or may not hurt your eyes

🛒 An attempt at an e-commerce system (discounts? maybe… bugs? definitely)

It’s not finished, it’s not perfect, and it’s full of errors 🐛 but it’s mine. And I appreciate the process because this project helped me level up a lot. So yeah, welcome to my beautiful mess
